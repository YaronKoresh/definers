## Installation

You can install the lightweight core components of **Definers** directly from its GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/YaronKoresh/definers.git
```

And if you already have CUDA installed, you can install the packages required for CUDA acceleration, by using the following format:

```bash
pip install "definers[cuda] @ git+https://github.com/YaronKoresh/definers.git"
```

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use Definers to summarize a piece of text:

```python
from definers import summary, init_pretrained_model

init_pretrained_model("summary",turbo=True)

long_text = """
The burgeoning field of artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming industries worldwide.
From healthcare to finance, AI algorithms are optimizing processes, uncovering insights from vast datasets,
and enabling innovations that were previously unimaginable. As the technology matures, it promises to
tackle even more complex challenges, heralding a new era of technological advancement.
"""
short_summary = summary(long_text, max_words=20)

print("Original Text Length:", len(long_text.split()))
print("Summary Text Length:", len(short_summary.split()))
print("\nSummary:")
print(short_summary)
```
